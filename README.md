# ToDo App

A flutter project to learn Dart and the Flutter framework, through application development instead of a never-ending tutorial hell.

A new branch will be created to hold the app everytime it is developed to a certain threshold of skill (as defined by me). 

## v0.1 Features
- Textbox to consume user input
- Capture user inputs into a task list (not persistent)
- Display un-finished task list to user

# v0.2
- Update AppBar for navigation (unfinished tasks + entry, completed task archive)
- Create pages according to the above navigation
- Update completeTask() logic (in main.dart)

# v0.3
- Create and employ a custom Task data model
- Allow user to change order of unfinished tasks
- Update unfinished task page design
